## Overview

This repository contains seven machine learning and artificial intelligence projects covering natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous code generation, and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Each project focuses on model training, hyperparameter optimization, performance evaluation, intelligent agent design, or LLM integration on real-world datasets and practical applications.

## Project One: Comment Sentiment Classification

The first project is **Comment Sentiment Classification** (`comment_sentiment_classification_project.ipynb`), which trains multiple models to classify user comments into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Various hyperparameters are tested across different models to discover the most optimal setting, and the best model is retrained on the full dataset to maximize classification accuracy on real-world comment data.

## Project Two: Image Segmentation

The second project is **Image Segmentation** (`image_segmentation_project.ipynb`), which performs semantic segmentation where each pixel of an image is assigned to a specific clothing category. The FashionMNIST dataset is used, containing images of models wearing different clothing items along with corresponding ground-truth masks. The project is designed to be generalizable and can be easily adapted to other datasets beyond fashion imagery.

## Project Three: Named Entity Recognition for Discourse Classification

The third project is **Named Entity Recognition for Discourse Classification** (`named_entity_recognition_project.ipynb`), which trains a sequence labeling model to classify text segments into discourse types. A single text may contain multiple rhetorical functions including Lead, B-Position, Claim, Counterclaim, Rebuttal, Evidence, and I-Concluding Statement. The dataset contains thousands of fully annotated argumentative texts, making this project valuable for understanding persuasive writing structures.

## Project Four: Simultaneous Object Localization and Classification

Unlike the previous projects that focused on classification (sentiment analysis), pixel-level labeling (segmentation), and sequence labeling (NER), the fourth project tackles the challenging task of **Simultaneous Object Localization and Classification** (`object_detector_implementation.ipynb`). The model detects multiple objects within a single image, drawing bounding boxes around each detected item and identifying its class from twenty possible categories, combining both localization and recognition in a single unified architecture.

## Project Five: AI Coding Agent with Gemini Function Calling

The fifth project is an **AI Coding Agent** (`codingagent`) that leverages Google's Gemini API to perform autonomous software engineering tasks through natural language conversation. The agent can read directory contents, read and write files, and execute programs. A calculator application is used to demonstrate the agent's capabilities. When the calculator works correctly, `3 + 7 * 2` evaluates to seventeen, but after breaking the precedence, it becomes twenty. The agent autonomously fixes the bug, restoring the correct result to seventeen. This complete debugging workflow is shown in screenshot `codingagent7.png`, and screenshots of many other demos are available in the screenshots folder.

## Project Six: RAG Question-Answering Bot

The sixth project is a **RAG Question-Answering Bot** (`qabotrag.py`) that enables users to upload PDF documents and ask natural language questions about their content using retrieval-augmented generation. The bot extracts text from uploaded PDFs, splits it into manageable chunks, and creates vector embeddings using Hugging Face sentence-transformers. When a user asks a question, the bot retrieves the top three most relevant chunks from ChromaDB and generates an accurate response using IBM watsonx.ai's Granite language model. The complete pipeline is wrapped in an intuitive Gradio web interface and deployed as a live Hugging Face Space, allowing anyone to upload documents and receive AI-generated answers in real time.

## Project Seven: Comparative Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Classification
The seventh project is Comparative Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Classification (fine_tuning_comparison.ipynb), which explores five transfer learning approaches to adapt a model pretrained on AG News (4-class news categorization) for IMDB binary sentiment analysis. Methods compared include training from scratch, full fine-tuning, classifier-only fine-tuning, adapters, LoRA, and QLoRA. Results show that while full fine-tuning and adapters achieve 86% accuracy, QLoRA delivers 84% accuracy with significantly lower computational cost, making it the optimal choice for resource-constrained environments.
